This was a project developed to manage stock and inventory. To help shops to avoid the daily problems of balancing the books that could be tedious when handled manually.

The system is designed to help administrators create, read, update and delete stock records (CRUD) as well as issue and receive items. At a glance it shows you the stock running low and prompt you to re-stock those goods. It also shows the overall quantity of items in the store.



The UI is designed in a way that clients/staff can easily search for items and convert to excel with ease. Products can also be added in excel or csv format.
